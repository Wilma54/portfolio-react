    <h1>A passionate and a driven Frontend Developer Student</h1>
    <p>I have always loved challenges and problems and to find the best way of solving them. </p>
    <p>My professional path started out with my love for magazines and I enjoyed working with the International business for years</p>
    <p>It was time for a new chapter and what couldÂ´nt be better than to start school again.</p>
    <p>I am still engaged in my passion for help others and solve problems, so becoming a Frontend Developer will let me continue my work. </p>
